Well this is weird. Here is a file and it contains some useful information of a specific kind.
You can call me on my american number 415-555-1234 or on my german mobile 0123 123456, if you are in Germany or with +49123 123456 from outside.
Here is a fun fact: The + in the phone number abbreviates a 00 so the number would actually be 00123 123456.
